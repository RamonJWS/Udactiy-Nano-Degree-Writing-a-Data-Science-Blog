<h1 align='center'> Investigating StackOverFlow Survey Data From 2017</h1>

## Project Motivation

By analysing the data provided by Stackoverflow it is possible to gain an understanding about what factors effect developers
and students when starting out in a field or improvind skills respectively. Specificially I wanted to answer 3 difference questions.

The information provided can help students better understand what salaries to expect for their first job, how to stay satisfied with their job once they get one, and finally how they could increase their salary.

## Blog Post

My Medium blog post about this top can be found [here](https://medium.com/@rayjosesantiago/are-students-salary-expectations-unreasonable-cac497ab9233).

## Questions

1). Do people who code as a hobby and work as a developer tend to have higher job satisaction?\
2). What are the biggest contributors towards salary?\
3). Are students expected salaries resonable for the top 5 most frequent countries in the survey?

## Results

1):

It was found that those who code for fun and or contribute to open source tended to have a higher percentage
that have job satisfaction of 8 and above. The results can be seen below:
